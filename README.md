CMOR is a content management system for ruby on rails.git 

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Architecture

CMOR modules live in the subfolders of this repository. Each module is a
separate gem that can be installed on its own. For convenience you can
install the cmor_suite gem. This will install all cmor modules at once.

If you want full control of all installation options you may want to install
the modules one by one.

## Running all specs

```

## Structuring modules

Functionality is separateted into modules. I.e. everything related to the blog is in the modules starting with cmor_blog.

## Structuring data

Most of the time things appear in categories/collection with items/resources. I.e. pictures are organized in galleries.

A collection should have at least following columns:

    locale
    identifier
    title
    description
    position
    slug
    published_at

Resources should have at least following columns:

    collection_id
    identifier
    title
    description
    position
    slug
    published_at
