              In order to offer the highest possible data protection, as well as the security
              of your account and the associated data, you can activate a two factor
              authentication. This authentication offers the protection of a second factor,
              which is activated via an app, e.g. the "Microsoft Authenticator" or "Google
              Authenticator".

              Security codes are used to access your account in case you cannot get two-factor
              authentication through your app. For security reasons, each code can only be used once.
              <hr />
              Print or copy your Backup Codes before continuing two-factor authentication setup.
