= Migrating from 1.x.x to 2.0.0

Add active_admin-awesome_nested_set to your gemfile, if you are using activeadmin:

    # Gemfile
    gem 'active_admin-awesome_nested_set'

= Prerequisites

if you are using activeadmin as backend, cmor_cms2 comes with admin files to provide a backend. In that case, you'll need active_admin-awesome_nested_set. Add it to your gemfile:

    # Gemfile
    gem 'active_admin-awesome_nested_set'

You may need to add therubyracer to your Gemfile:

    # Gemfile
    gem 'therubyracer'

= Installation

Add it to your bundle:

  # Gemfile:
  gem 'cmor_cms2'

Install your bundle:

  > bundle install

Install the intializer:

  > rails g cmor:cms:install

Generate migrations and migrate:

  > rake cmor_cms:install:migrations
  > rake db:migrate

= Optional: Generating example/default data

There is a task to prepopulate your database tables with example data.

Warning: *RUNNING THIS WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR CMS DATA AND REPLACE IT WITH EXAMPLE DATA!*

  > rake cmor:cms:db:populate!

= Linking to pages

    <%= link_to 'My Page', page_path(i18n_locale: I18n.locale, page: 'my-page') %>

= Using partials form the database in other controllers

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      prepend_view_path ::Cmor::Cms::PartialResolver.instance
      ...
    end

= Using the navigation helper

    # app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      helper Cmor::CmsHelper
      ...
    end

Then you can render navigation in your views:

    # app/views/_navigation.rb
    = cms_render_navigation(:main)

= Running specs

    gem install bundler
    bundle
    cd spec/dummy && rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test && cd ../..
    guard
