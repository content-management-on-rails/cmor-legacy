          <p>
            In order to offer the highest possible data protection, as well as the security
            of your account and the associated data, you can activate a two factor
            authentication. This authentication offers the protection of a second factor,
            which is activated via an app, e.g. the "Microsoft Authenticator" or "Google
            Authenticator".

            Security codes are used to access your account in case you cannot get two-factor
            authentication through your app. For security reasons, each code can only be used once.

            Print or copy your Backup Codes before continuing two-factor authentication setup.
